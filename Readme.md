# App Sentiment Search (Next.js Frontend)

A simple Next.js frontend application that allows users to:

- Search for an app name.
- View a dropdown of suggestions.
- Select an app and fetch its sentiment score and total number of reviews.

This project demonstrates:

- Controlled inputs with real-time suggestions.
- Basic API integration using Axios.
- Conditional rendering and request management (loading state, single fetch at a time).
- Minimal styling using inline styles, no external CSS.
